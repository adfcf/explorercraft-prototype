# explorercraft-prototype
## What is it?
One of those Minecraft clones, a prototype actually. It was made using C#/OpenTK. 
The main intention was to play with OpenTK, so it doesn't feature any complexity -
it only allows you to fly around a simple terrain covered by some trees. That's all.

## Additional information
- It uses a Perlin noise implementation made by Adrian Biagioli and it was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/Flafla2/1a0b9ebef678bbce3215#file-perlin-cs).
- It uses SixLabors's image loading library as informed by Dependencies.txt.
- I tried to have some fun with lighting. The results weren't fancy, but pretty. Compare the last screenshot I have put here (no lighting effects) with the other ones.
- I __might__ create a proper version of this so-called ExplorerCraft with real gameplay in the future...
